                <h3>About PÃ©ter</h3>

                <p>I've started building websites in 2002. Okay, maybe the first ones were monochromatic with iframes and looked like a SPA during these days. But it was a website! :) Since then the web technology have changed a lot. I was paying attention to these changes and always looked for the new solutions. So the iframes died to me soon too.</p>

                <p>My passion to create stuff for the web turned into a serious interest when I finished the six week long university trainee assignement at Dolphio Consulting in 2010. I have created a CakePHP based newsletter application and received a very positive feedback with my attitude and dedication to this kind of work. I knew, this is what I want to do, after I graduate from the university. During the last semesters I've focused my attention and free time on the web development topic and created many real websites for people and small companies around me.</p>

                <p>After the university, I started working as web developer and finally I could pay enough attention and time to learn all the missing pieces. Since 2013 I work as a full stack developer learning new techniques during the every day tasks.</p>

                <p>If you are a child or an <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/AFOL" target="_blank">AFOL</a> you don't need an explanation for this section. If you are one of the grown-ups, I can't turn you over, you need to go down this path on your own dear padawan!</p>

                <p>I've decided to write a lightweight <a href="/lego/">blog</a>, about my AFOL activity.</p>

                <h3>Youtube</h3>

                <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JARJARMP" target="_blank">Youtube</a> and other online video sharing platforms are more and more popular as time goes by. Who wants to stay behind with webdev tutorial videos? Me neither...</p>

                <p>First I've uploaded gameplays and when I turned away from gaming to web development, I've started to upload screencasts. Also planning to create new ones, since those series are outdated by now.</p>

                <h3>TV-Shows (Series)</h3>
                
                <p>For relaxing or thinking or crying or laughing purposes, either is it so good or happens to be so bad, I can suggest you tv&#8209;shows/series to watch - based on my taste of course.
