                    <p class="light">Small companies, weddings of friends, music bands or gaming communities - I was always there to create a website for that! Sometimes just a simple static page, but other ones were built for example with dynamic gift-reservation or community (user) based gaming-data sharing feature. Finally I've ended up working 9-to-5 to server "real client's" requests.</p>

                    <p class="light">It hurts, but web is not everything in this world. Sometimes you have to code offline applications to solve specific tasks. I've learned a lot about Visual Basic during the highschool years, so I used it later to develop quickly apps for Windows based systems.</p>
