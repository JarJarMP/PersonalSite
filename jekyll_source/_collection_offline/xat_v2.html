                <p>After the successful launch of the <a href="/projects/offline/xat-v1/" target="_top">first, rewritten version</a> we've received many suggestions, requests and great feedback. Based on that we revisited the project and planned a second version with better performance, UI and easier usage. We started at begining of 2014 creating the new application, which was built wtih a lot more flexibilty and extendability, than the previous one.</p>

                <p>I've developed a general form class, which is able to dynamically generate VB forms with almost any kind of input fields, positioning them into multiple columns. These forms have automatic CRUD functionality if you have the correct database naming convention, also real time and visible data validation and different hook points such as before save, before delete.</p>
                
                <p>All you need is one single class to describe your form (fields, database columns, validations), and the rest is dark magic via my generic form builder.</p>
