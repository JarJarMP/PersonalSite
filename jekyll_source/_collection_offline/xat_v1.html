                <p>My brother and I took over a university department project in 2013. We had to rewrite a poorly structured and coded C#-MSSQL application. Main goal was to create the same look and functionality as the previous in a couple of months. That's how we had to develop eg. responsive UI for a Windows application, which is pretty unique, in my opinon.</p>

                <p>The application uses a database to store different kind of reports (simple datalist of real world objects) and after a user login you can search and edit these reports. Also there is a lot math and statistic feature built upon these data, displaying their results in table or chart formats.</p>
