                <p>At the end of my BME education, I had to create my 'masterpiece' a.k.a. thesis. I've built a Windows application to manage theater shows and scenes on a graphical UI, working together with a PLC controlled stage system. This was a real world project with actual requirements, so I could work on something real, with a real client.</p>

                <p>There was a few areas, where I could learn new approaches and techniques. Such as serial port communication and Siemens PLC communication protocol.</p>
