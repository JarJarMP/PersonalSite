<h5>BME VÃ¡ndor 2010</h5>

<p>The purpose was to create a dynamic site for the easier tour-class management. Sadly the university removed that class from the supported list, so we never had the chance to use the site. (CakePHP, Mercurial)</p>

<h5>Movie tracking site 2009</h5>

<p>t started as a great idea (not mine) to create a social site for tracking watched movies, very similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://whatnext.eu/">WhatNext.eu</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://moly.hu/">Moly.hu</a>. The engine development (my part) was ready, when the leader guy and his designer dropped the project.</p>

<h5>djborze 2009</h5>

<p>I've extended the existing site with community features, such as more complex personal profile. Design was given, only the PHP part was mine.</p>

<h5>Poisoned Peppers 2008</h5>

<p>Rock band's website, whitout the rock band. They've stopped playing music together, the site was used during their active time.</p>
