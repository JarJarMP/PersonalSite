<p>I was collecting personal sites of developers and designers for a long time. One day there was more than enough to manage them in a Chrome bookmark folder, also wasn't much use of it existing only on my computer. So I transformed all the bookmarks to an alphabetical list and shared with those awesome people via GitHub.</p>
