<h5>University Internship 2010</h5>

<p>One big task during the BME's education is to work 6 week at a company and create something on your own. I've coded a custom newsletter sending application based on CakePHP for inside usage (the application wasn't sold, but used for the employees).</p>

<h5>Independent Laboratory 2010</h5>

<p>At the middle of the BME's education you have to develop/create something by yourself and you have one semester for it beside the other classes. I've developed a custom CMS as an interactive (e)manual for an existing network analyser software.</p>
