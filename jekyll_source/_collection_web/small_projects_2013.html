<h5>Kadlicsek pigeons v1</h5>

<p>My dear friend, Ádám has a nice amount of race pigeons and many years of experience to raise them. He decided to start a simple blog to share his experience. I wrote the CodeIgniter based engine and worked together with a webdesigner for the layout.</p>

<p>If you want to read about pigeons (in hungarian), <a href="http://kadlicsekpigeons.herobo.com/" target="_blank" title="Kadlicsek Pigeons blog">check out his site.</a></p>

<p>In <a target="_top" href="/projects/web/small-projects-2014">2014</a> I've updated the whole site, and installed for him a WordPress based system, with a simple theme.</p>
