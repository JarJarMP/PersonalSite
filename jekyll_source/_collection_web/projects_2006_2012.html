<h5>Sanxo</h5>

<p>Company portfolio site with instant language selector (3 languages). I've developed the PHP engine and also createed the HTML layouts based on their design plans.</p>

<h5>Nuuun</h5>

<p>My task was to create a custom WordPress theme for the designer blog based on the PSD files they gave me.</p>

<h5>Apps for interactive whiteboard</h5>

<p>JavaScript based math apps for grade school teachers (These were their requests, not my own ideas, what to code as a math app).</p>

<h5>Optimalist</h5>

<p>Shopping list optimizer in a very early stage, with minimal features. (v2 is on the way with many new ideas in 2015)</p>

<h5>Hungarian characters</h5>

<p>A big form with buttons of the hungarian special characters. The idea was to write full charset emails all around the world, where there is no hungarian language installed on the computer.</p>
