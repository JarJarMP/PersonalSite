<h5>Background</h5>

<p>Larkinor is a simple, browser based, MMORPG game written by hungarian developers. It was launched during the 56k years, and I spent a humble 10 years to play it. Larki Lexikon was my idea during my last years to create a community driven knowledge base, but the other players werent as excited as I was.</p>

<h5>v1</h5>

<p>I've started working on the first version in 2012. It was a very simple, plain PHP application with poorly designed database and appearance.</p>

<h5>v2</h5>

<p>A necessary rewrite shortly after the launch of v1, but it was still plain PHP with better database structure.</p>

<h5>v3</h5>

<p>In 2013 I've started again from zero with CodeIgniter and Twitter Bootstrap (for quick design). Thoroughly redesigned database, full MVC, different user levels and capabilities with admin dashboard. Sadly the community was dying too fast, so the interest to keep it up to date was minimal.</p>
