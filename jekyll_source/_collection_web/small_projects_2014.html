<h5>Crawlers</h5>

<p>I've updated the data crawler logic for a currency comparsion site.</p>

<h5>Kadlicsek pigeons v2</h5>

<p>I was horrified from my own code and the user interface (<a target="_top" href="/projects/web/small-projects-2013">v1</a>), so I had to change the engine to WordPress. The design seemed outdated too, so we've selected a template instead of another raising-star designer.</p>

<h5>Vir Kucsa</h5>

<p>A simple, static website for a rentable family apartman in Vir, Croatia.</p>

<h5>Wedding site</h5>

<p>Static content about one of my friend's wedding. Dynamic feature was the gift-booking system, with a simple admin page and email notification.</p>
