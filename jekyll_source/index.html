Sometimes just a simple static page, but other ones were built for example with dynamic gift-reservation or community (user) based gaming-data sharing feature. Finally I've ended up working 9-to-5 to server "real client's" requests.</p>

I've learned a lot about Visual Basic during the highschool years, so I used it later to develop quickly apps for Windows based systems.</p>

Since then I have built a lot of websites, mostly as side projects for gaming communities and small companies. With time and practice I have learned enough to work as a full time web developer. Currently I am on duty in the army of <a href="http://madtatu.com/" target="_blank" title="MadTatu Development">MadTatu Development</a>.</p>
